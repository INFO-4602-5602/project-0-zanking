Project 0 - Zanqing Feng

I worked with Ming Qi Liew, one of my classmate of the other course who knows about D3 really well, on this project. This is my first time hand on D3, I was looking up the tutorial of D3 while typing code, and with Ming Qi's help. Even though it took a lot time, I felt much more better with using D3 to build visualization. In short, I still need to practice more on D3. The more practice I take, the more proficiency I get.
